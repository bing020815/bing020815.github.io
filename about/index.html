	<div class="introduction">
	<p>Hi, I am a working professional in the petrochemical industry with various academic backgrounds, <abbr title="Bachelor of Science">BS</abbr> in Mathematics, <abbr title="Master of Science">MS</abbr> in <abbr title="Industrial Engineering">IE</abbr> and <abbr title="Master of Science">MS</abbr> in <abbr title="Applied Data Science">ADS</abbr>. I am also an amateur photographer who loves to travel and cook. ðŸ˜‹ Currently, I am staying in New Jersey and New York metropolitan area.</p>
        <p>Although I have got in touch with the data field on and off in the past, my data science journey officially starts from the end of 2018. I took online courses from Udemy, Coursera, and other sources. It is an endless learning journey. Everything I have learned is just the tip of the iceberg. There are still many fields in this area. Recently, I am interested in building AI solutions using <em>Computer Vision</em>, <em>Image Recognition</em>, and <em>NLP</em>. <em>Big data</em> and <em>Cloud Computing</em> are other fields that I would like to keep working on. <q>Putting knowledge into practice</q> has always been my motto. And, I would like to be part of the contributors to contribute to society.
