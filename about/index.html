	<div class="introduction">
	<p>Hi, I am a working professional in the petrochemical industry with various academic backgrounds, BS in Mathematics, MS in IE and MS in ADS. I am also an amateur photographer who loves to travel and cook. ðŸ˜‹ Currently, I am staying in New Jersey and New York metropolitan area.</p>
        <p>Although I have got in touch with the data field on and off in the past, my data science journey officially starts from the end of 2018. I took online courses from Udemy, Coursera, and other sources. It is an endless learning journey. Everything I have learned is just the tip of the iceberg. There are still many fields in this area. Recently, I am interested in building AI solutions using Computer Vision, Image Recognition, and NLP. Big data and Cloud Computing are other fields that I would like to keep working on. Putting knowledge into practice has always been my motto. And, I would like to be part of the contributors to contribute to society.
