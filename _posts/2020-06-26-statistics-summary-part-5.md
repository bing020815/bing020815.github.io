## Probability

Probability is simply how likely something is to happen. 

Whenever we're unsure about the outcome of an event, we can talk about the probabilities of certain outcomesâ€”how likely they are. The analysis of events governed by probability is called statistics.


This post is going to cover the following:
1. [Joint Probability](#jointprob)
2. [Union of Events](#unionevents)
3. [Conditional Probability](#conditionalprob)


<h3 id="jointprob"><strong>(1). Joint Probability:</strong></h3> 

Joint probability is a statistical measure that calculates the likelihood of two events occurring together and at the same point in time. Joint probability is the probability of event Y occurring at the same time that event X occurs.

<ul style="list-style: none;">
  <li>The formula for Joint Probability is:</li>
  <li style="display: inline; margin-right: 10%">$P(A \text{ or } B) = P(A \cup B)= P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$</li>
  <li style="display: inline; ">$\text{when events A and B are independent}$</li>
</ul>


<br>

<h3 id="unionevents"><strong>(2). Union of Events:</strong></h3> 

Union of Events. The union of events A and B, denoted $A \cup B$, is the collection of all outcomes that are elements of one or the other of the sets A and B, or of both of them.

<ul style="list-style: none;">
  <li>The formula for Union of Events is:</li>
  <li style="display: inline; margin-right: 10%">$P(A \text{ and } B) = P(A \cap B)= P(A) \times P(B)$</li>
</ul>

<br>



<h3 id="conditionalprob"><strong>(3). Conditional Probability:</strong></h3> 

Conditional probability is the probability of one event occurring with some relationship to one or more other events. 

For example: Event A is that it is raining outside, and it has a 0.3 (30%) chance of raining today. Event B is that you will need to go outside, and that has a probability of 0.5 (50%). A conditional probability would look at these two events in relationship with one another, such as the probability that it is both raining and you will need to go outside.

<ul style="list-style: none;">
  <li>The formula for Conditional Probability is:</li>
  <br>
  <li style="display: inline; margin-right: 10%;">$P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \text{ and } B)}{P(B)} = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)}$</li>
  <li style="display: inline;">$Posterior = \frac{Prior \times Likelihood}{\text{Marginal Probability of Evidence}}$</li>
  <li><p align="center" style="font-size: 0.8em; color: grey; font-style: italic;">Bayes' Theorem</p></li>

</ul>


__Example 1:__   

Assume that eye color is an autosomally inherited trait controlled by one gene with two alleles. Brown is dominant to blue. A brown-eyed man with genotype Bb and a blue-eyed woman have three children. The first has blue eyes. What is the probability that all three children have blue eyes?



||B|b|
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|__b__|Bb|bb|
|__b__|Bb|bb|  


The probability that the couple has three children with blue eyes is:

<p align="center">$
P(A \text{ and } B) = P(\text{other 2 children = bb and 1st child bb}) = 0.5 \times 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.125
$</p>

Therefore, 
<p align="center">$
P(\text{other 2 children = bb | 1st child bb})= P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \text{ and } B)}{P(B)} = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{0.125}{0.5} = 0.25
$</p>


__Example 2:__   

Based on the analysis of her pedigree, it is determined that a woman has a 70% chance of being Zz and a 30% chance of being ZZ for a sex-linked trait, where Z is dominant to z. IF she now has a son with the Z phenotype, what is the probability of her being Zz.

The target is to find:
<p align="center">$
P(A|B) = P(\text{woman=Zz | Son with the Z phenotype})
$</p>

However, two events, $A:\text{woman=Zz}$ and $B: \text{Son with the Z phenotype}$ are not independent.  
Thus, we use conditional probability:

<p align="center">$
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)}
$</p>
<p align="center">$
P(B|A) = P(\text{Son with the Zphenotype | woman=Zz }) = 0.5
$</p>
<p align="center"><i>50% of chance of passing on the Z allele</i></p>
<p align="center">$
P(A) = P(woman=Zz) = 0.7
$</p>
<p align="center"><i>Given</i></p>
<p align="center">$
P(B) = P(\text{Son with the Z phenotype}) = (0.7 \times 0.5)+(0.3 \times 1) = 0.65
$</p>
<p align="center"><i>Son can be Z from the woman being either Zz or ZZ</i></p>

<p align="center">$
P(\text{woman=Zz | Son with the Z phenotype}) = \frac{0.5 \times 0.7}{0.65} = 0.538
$</p>
